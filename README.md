# gridworld_rllib

Example implementation of an [OpenAI Gym](http://gym.openai.com/) environment,
to illustrate problem representation for [RLlib](https://rllib.io/) use cases.

## Usage

Clone the repo and connect into its top level directory.

To initialize and run the `gym` example:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e gym-example
python sample.py
```

My Code is based on the Github Repository from [DerwenAI](https://github.com/DerwenAI/gym_example).
A step by step tutorial is given [Here](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/anatomy-of-a-custom-environment-for-rllib-327157f269e5).
